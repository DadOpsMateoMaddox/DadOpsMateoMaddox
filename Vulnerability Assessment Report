<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 1st January 20XX</p>
<p><strong>Prepared by:</strong> Kevin Landry</p>
<p><strong>Position:</strong> Cybersecurity Analyst</p>

<hr>

<h2>System Description</h2>
<p>The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It operates on the latest version of the Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. The server is configured with a stable IPv4 network connection and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The scope of this vulnerability assessment is focused on the access controls of the system. The assessment period covers three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX, and follows the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidelines to guide the risk analysis of the information system.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Assessing the vulnerability of this system is essential due to the critical role the database server plays in the business. This system stores sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of customers, which is frequently targeted by cyber threats. Should an attacker infiltrate the system through a vulnerability like SQL injection, the company risks a complete data breach, leading to significant reputational damage and potential revenue loss. Disabling the server could also halt business operations, severely impacting customer trust and company stability.</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>In evaluating the risks to the company’s public-facing database, I focused on common threat sources and events that could exploit the server's vulnerabilities. These include external cybercriminals aiming to exfiltrate customer data, malicious insiders who may misuse legitimate access, and zero-day vulnerabilities in the MySQL server that could be exploited remotely.</p>

<p>This qualitative assessment uses a severity-likelihood framework to balance the probability and potential impact of each threat source on the company’s operations and reputation. By prioritizing high-severity threats, the assessment ensures that critical risks are addressed first, especially those compromising customer trust and business continuity. Identifying specific risks and proposing targeted mitigations minimizes exposure and enhances data security.</p>

<h2>Remediation Strategy</h2>
<p>To safeguard the database server, I recommend implementing authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms. These measures should include strong password policies, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to restrict user privileges. Data encryption should use TLS (instead of SSL) for enhanced security during data transmission. Additionally, IP allow-listing should be applied to limit access to corporate offices only, thereby reducing exposure from the public internet.</p>

<p>This report provides a structured assessment of the current vulnerabilities within the company’s system, aimed at guiding stakeholders toward informed, security-focused decisions.</p>
