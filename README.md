<h1>Hi, I'm Kevin! <br/><a href="https://github.com/MaddoxsDad">Cybersecurity Professional</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlandrycyber">George Mason Graduate student April 2025🚀 </a></h1>

<h2>👨‍💻 Software Development Projects:</h2>

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**
  - [Red-Black Tree Implementation](https://github.com/MaddoxsDad/RedBlack)
  - */This project implements a Red-Black Tree (RBT), a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion operations. The Red-Black Tree maintains balance by enforcing specific rules on node colors and rotations, leading to an optimal time complexity of O(log n) for common operations.

🔹 Features:
✔ Insertion & Deletion Operations – Maintains tree balance with rotations and color flipping.
✔ Search Optimization – Guarantees O(log n) lookup times for large datasets.
✔ Visualization Support – Outputs structured tree representation for debugging.
✔ Error Handling & Validation – Prevents invalid tree states with robust checks.

🔹 Key Concepts Demonstrated:
✅ Data Structures & Algorithms – Demonstrates self-balancing trees for efficient searching.
✅ Memory Management – Efficiently allocates and deallocates nodes.
✅ Sorting & Searching Efficiency – Used in databases, networking, and compilers.

🚀 Real-World Applications:
🔹 Used in database indexing (e.g., TreeMap in Java, STL map in C++).
🔹 Applied in memory management (Linux kernel uses Red-Black Trees for scheduler queues).
🔹 Essential for high-performance search engines and routing tables.\*
