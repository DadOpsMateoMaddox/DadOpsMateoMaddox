## 🎯 About Me

I'm a **cybersecurity professional** and **veteran** passionate about breaking into cybersecurity and software development. I specialize in threat hunting, adversarial emulations, and IoC enrichment through various honeypot projects. I also train AI to be used as a tool to help harden vulnerable networks and systems.

**🔹 Experience:** InfoSec since 2005  
**🔹 Education:** George Mason University Graduate Student (April 2025)  
**🔹 Achievement:** 2nd Place USCC CTF Participant  
**🔹 Role:** Team player, leader, and father  

I put **a lot of work** into these projects, although I have many more that I don't have on GitHub yet! 🥷🏻  
**Enjoy**, and see you in the logs!
