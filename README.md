##  ☠️ Cyber Projects☠️
## 🛡️ Honeypot and Threat Intelligence Operations

- **Live Attack Honeypot Deployment** (Currently Active)
  - Built and tuned Cowrie honeypots in DigitalOcean environments.
  - Captures SSH/Telnet brute force attacks, malware payloads, and persistence attempts.
  - Integrated with:
    - **SHODAN API** for real-time inbound threat telemetry.
    - **VirusTotal API** for automated malware sample enrichment and threat attribution.
  - Logs, artifacts, and attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) are analyzed and archived.

- **Real-World Outcomes**
  - Threat actor tracking and behavioral profiling.
  - Payload isolation and secure analysis workflows.
  - Hardened honeypot systems to mislead, trap, and frustrate malicious operators.
