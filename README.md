## ⚡ The SitRep

I don’t do *theoretical*. I build.

I am an **M.S. Cybersecurity student at George Mason University** (Applied IT: Cyber Track) with a background forged in **mission-critical kinetic operations**—keeping ships afloat in the **Bering Sea** and protecting **oil terminals in Iraq**. Today, I apply that same mindset to:

- Cloud Systems Engineering  
- Adversarial Deception  
- Threat Hunting & Intelligence  

I build tools from scratch because I need to know **exactly how the gears turn**.  
I don’t just run scripts-I write the software that **catches the people running the scripts**.

**Current Status:**  
Actively hunting for a role where I can **break things, fix things, and be impactful**.  
I’ve built **9 custom honeypots and counting**.  
Put me in the fight.

## 🛠️ The Arsenal (Custom Projects)

Every project below is **custom-built from scratch**.  
No copy-paste tutorials.  
I build these to **understand the adversary**.

---

## 🍯 Deception Engineering & Threat Intelligence

### **HONEYBOMBCERBERUS**

**The Gist:**  
Not just a honeypot—this is a **research lab disguised as a victim**.

**The Tech:**  
- AI GuardDog  
- Shodan API  
- VirusTotal API  
- Custom TTP analytics pipeline  

**Why it Matters:**  
This platform doesn’t just log attempts—it **enriches attacker data in real time**.  
It captures malware samples, records keystrokes, and builds attacker profiles that generate **actionable intelligence**, not noise.

---

### **Corie Death Pot**

**The Gist:**  
A highly aggressive **Cowrie deployment template**.

**The Tech:**  
- Custom tripwires  
- Shodan monitoring hooks  

**Why it Matters:**  
Standard honeypots get fingerprinted fast.  
This one is engineered to **hold attackers longer**, extracting deeper behavioral data before they realize they’re inside a cage.

Includes **full deployment documentation** because I believe in **open-source defense**.

---

### **CowrieGPT-Access**

**The Gist:**  
Psychological warfare—for bots.

**The Tech:**  
- Python middleware bridging Cowrie logs with ChatGPT  

**Why it Matters:**  
Static responses are predictable.  
This enables **dynamic interpretation of attacker behavior**, using LLMs to analyze **intent behind shell commands**, not just syntax.

---

## 🔍 Threat Analysis & Vulnerability Management

### **MultiThreatScanner**

**The Gist:**  
Why juggle five threat feeds when one tool can do it?

**The Tech:**  
- Python-based aggregation engine  
- VirusTotal  
- AlienVault OTX  
- Additional threat intel sources  

**Why it Matters:**  
Speed kills- or saves —in Incident Response.  
This tool produces a **unified risk score and report instantly**, without tab-hopping.

---

### **Offline CVSS Calculators (2025 Edition)**

**The Gist:**  
Vulnerability scoring in **air-gapped or secure environments**.

**The Tech:**  
- Standalone CVSS v3.x computation logic  
- Optional OpenAI hook for narrative recommendations  

**Why it Matters:**  
The core tool works when **the internet is dark**.  
The AI component is optional—not required.  
Designed for **secure facility audits and restricted networks**.

---

## 🧬 Algorithms & Core Engineering

### **Red-Black Trees & Bloom Filters**

**The Gist:**  
Prove you know the fundamentals.

**The Tech:**  
- Raw Java implementations  
- Raw Python implementations  

**Why it Matters:**  
Understanding **memory efficiency, probabilistic structures, and search complexity** makes me a better security engineer—not just a tool user.

## ⚓ The Origin Story (Kinetic Operations)

Before I hunted threats in the cloud, I hunted them **in the real world**.  
I served nearly **a decade in the U.S. Coast Guard**.

---

## 🧊 District 17 -The Frozen North (Alaska)

**Role:**  
Comms Watch Officer / SAR Controller

**The Mission:**  
Search & Rescue in *Deadliest Catch* waters.  
Coordinated comms for vessels in distress and hikers facing **Kodiak Grizzly attacks** (not a joke).

**The Grind:**  
- Satellite tactical communications  
- Encrypted VHF / UHF / HF  
- Mission-critical comms integrity  

If comms failed, people didn’t get found.  
I made sure they didn’t fail.

**Flex:**  
- Advanced to **E-5 at 19**  
- Advanced to **E-6 at 21**

## 🏜️ USCGC *Aquidneck* -The Sandbox (Iraq Deployment)

**Role:**  
Operations Specialist in Charge (AOPS)

**The Mission:**  
Volunteered for deployment to the **Northern Arabian Gulf** (Oct 2002).

**The Stakes:**  
Anti-Terrorism / Force Protection (ATFP) for:  
- ABOT  
- KAAOT  

Stopping **VBIEDs (suicide boats)** from destroying the world’s largest offshore oil platforms.

*Rest in Peace, DC3 Nathan Bruckenthal.*

## 🌪️ Sector San Juan & Katrina -The Storms

**Role:**  
Base OOD / Assistant Patrol Boat Manager

**The Mission:**  
- Deepwater operations  
- Disaster response  

**The Grind:**  
- Apprehended human traffickers (Operation Monkey Wrench II)  
- Deployed to Mississippi supporting FEMA and National Guard during **Hurricane Katrina recovery**

---

## 🎖️ The Hardware

- Achievement Medal (with “O” Device)  
- Presidential Unit Citation  
- Meritorious Team Commendation (Gold Star)  
- Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal  
- **Plankowner:** Department of Homeland Security (original crew, first 80k)

## 📡 Transmission Ends

I build these tools **for the community**.  
Use my scripts. Fork my repos. Improve them.

If you’re hiring and want someone who has handled pressure from the **Bering Sea to the Persian Gulf**—and can write the Python to secure your cloud infrastructure—**reach out**.
