## Coast Guard Service & Achievements

Before diving into cybersecurity, I served nearly a decade in the U.S. Coast Guard as an Operations Specialist (OS) (But enlisted as a Telecommunications Specialist. During that time I:

-**Became a Plankowner of the Department of Homeland Security meaning I was among the first 80,000 or so to be placed in the Department of Homeland Security  
- **USCGC DALLAS (WHEC-716)**: Served as communications petty officer and EKMS manager. Oversaw shipboard communications, training and key management. Coordinated port visits to more than 15 countries and supported humanitarian relief missions like **Operation Noble Delivery** to the Republic of Georgia.

- **USCGC Aquidneck (WPB-1309)**: Proudly volunteered to deploy to Iraq October 2002 as Operation Specialist in charge and AOPS of the relief crew for all 4 patrol boats in the AOR but Aquidneck was my main. Conducted Anti-Terrorism-Force-Protection of the A-Bot and K-Bot terminals against Vehicle Born Improvised Explosive Devices )a.k.a. suicide bombers trying to un-alive themselves by blowing up both of the largest offshore oil terminals in the worl)d. Rest in Peace [DC3 Nathan Brukentall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Bruckenthal)

- **Returned in One Piece**: Returned to the Command Center to finish out my tour before leaving for the polar opposite assignment and geographic area,
  
- **Sector San Juan (Deepwater operations)**: Base officer of the day and assistant patrol boat manager. Helped apprehend human traffickers during **Operation Monkey Wrench II**, coordinated law enforcement and firefighting training, and assisted FEMA and the Mississippi National Guard during Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.
- **District 17 Communications Center**: Communications watch officer and watch supervisor. Participated in **Unified Defense Exercise 04** (the first post-9/11 interagency terrorism exercise in Alaska), advanced quickly through the OS ranks, and ensured around-the-clock communications for search and rescue missions.

Over my Coast Guard career I earned multiple commendations and awards, including the  **Achievement Medal with "O" Operational Designator**, **Meritorious Team Commendation** (with a gold star), **Meritorious Unit Commendation**, **Presidential Unit Citation**, **Commandant‚Äôs Letter of Commendation**, the **Coast Guard ‚ÄúE‚Äù Ribbon**,, **Hurricane Katrina Award** **Good Conduct medals**, **Sea Service** and **Special Operations** ribbons, **Rifle** and **Pistol Marksmanship** ribbons, the **Humanitarian Service Medal**, **Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary** and **Service Medals**, and a **Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation**.

and now: üòà I am M.S. Cybersecurity student at George Mason University's College of Engineering and Computing's Applied IT: Cybersecurity tract. I build open-source honeypots (HoneyBomb), tools, Python threat-intelligence tools, and other stuff that interests me but haven't pushed to any of my repo's yet just because of time. But expect a big push SOON though!üòÅ 

I‚Äôm passionate about my family, animals, threat hunting, incident response, vulnerability assessments, breaking stuff, AI Asssited-Cybersecurity and how to harden against advererial AI attack methods, adversarial emulation, and modern cyber cloud defense. With over 20 years in INFOSEC, Physical Security, and COMSEC, I love exploring new tech, collaborating with others, and helping secure systems.....(and I also gameüëÄ) Thanks for stopping by!

## Cybersecurity Projects
