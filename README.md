## Coast Guard Service & Achievements

Before diving into cybersecurity, I served nearly a decade in the U.S. Coast Guard as an Operations Specialist (OS). During that time I:

- **USCGC DALLAS (WHEC-716)**: Served as communications petty officer and EKMS manager. Oversaw shipboard communications, training and key management. Coordinated port visits to more than 15 countries and supported humanitarian relief missions like **Operation Noble Delivery** to the Republic of Georgia.
- **Sector San Juan (Deepwater operations)**: Base officer of the day and assistant patrol boat manager. Helped apprehend human traffickers during **Operation Monkey Wrench II**, coordinated law enforcement and firefighting training, and assisted FEMA and the Mississippi National Guard during Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.
- **District 17 Communications Center**: Communications watch officer and watch supervisor. Participated in **Unified Defense Exercise 04** (the first post-9/11 interagency terrorism exercise in Alaska), advanced quickly through the OS ranks, and ensured around-the-clock communications for search and rescue missions.

Over my Coast Guard career I earned multiple commendations and awards, including the **Meritorious Team Commendation** (with a gold star), **Meritorious Unit Commendation**, **Presidential Unit Citation**, **Commandant‚Äôs Letter of Commendation**, the **Coast Guard ‚ÄúE‚Äù Ribbon**, **Achievement Medal**, **Good Conduct medals**, **Sea Service** and **Special Operations** ribbons, **Rifle** and **Pistol Marksmanship** ribbons, the **Humanitarian Service Medal**, **Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary** and **Service Medals**, and a **Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation**„Äê141425348955542‚Ä†L143-L150„Äë„Äê430154381106141‚Ä†L167-L174„Äë.

I‚Äôm a Coast Guard veteran and M.S. Cybersecurity student at Syracuse University. I build open-source honeypots (HoneyBomb) and Python threat-intelligence tools, and I‚Äôm passionate about threat hunting, adversarial emulation, and modern cyber defense. With over 20 years in INFOSEC, I love exploring new tech, collaborating with others, and helping secure systems. Thanks for stopping by!

## Cybersecurity Projects
